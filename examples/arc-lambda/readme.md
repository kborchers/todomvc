# architect/Lambda/DynamoDB TodoMVC Example

> Event driven programming with cloud functions can be tricky to set up and maintain. architect offers a simple plaintext manifest and npm script based workflows for provisioning, deploying, orchestrating, and working offline with cloud infrastructure.

> Using [architect](https://arc.codes), this example adds a persistent store via [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and all interaction with DynamoDB as well as the loading of all content is done via [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).
